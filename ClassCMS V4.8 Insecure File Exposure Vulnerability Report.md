# Insecure File Exposure Vulnerability Report

## Description
An insecure file exposure vulnerability exists in ClassCMS V4.8. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit short file names to directly download sensitive files, such as the SQLite database file. Since the database file is stored in the root directory of the website, an attacker can use this method to access sensitive data, including administrator usernames and passwords.

## Download URL
[https://github.com/ClassCMS/ClassCMS/releases/tag/v4.8](https://github.com/ClassCMS/ClassCMS/releases/tag/v4.8)

## Version
V4.8

## Tested Environment
- PHP
- Apache
- SQLite

## Affected Page
Website root directory (e.g., `/`)

## Vulnerability Details
ClassCMS supports SQLite as a database option, and the SQLite database file is stored in the root directory of the website. Due to improper access control, attackers can use short file names to directly download the database file. Once the file is downloaded, the attacker can extract sensitive information such as administrator account credentials, leading to severe security risks.

## Proof of Vulnerability
## Proof of Vulnerability

1. The system's source code defaults to using SQLite as the database during installation. On the CMS installation interface, you can observe that the SQLite database file name is randomly generated, but it typically follows the default naming convention `db_xxxxxxxxxx.db`.
